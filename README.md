# Gatornet - A Palestinian Social Network

## Overview

**Gatornet** is a project aimed at solving a critical issue faced by the Palestinian community: censorship of Palestinian content on traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and others. These platforms often restrict and remove content that is pro-Palestinian or critical of the occupation, leaving many in the Palestinian community without a fair and unbiased space to express themselves.

Our goal is to provide a Palestinian alternative to Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms. Gatornet aims to be as close as possible to Western counterparts in terms of functionality, offering most (if not all) of the features already present on Facebook. This way, we can ensure a fair, honest, and free user experience for the Palestinian people.

This is the initial version of the platform, where we have laid the foundations for further development. By following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Agile Development** practices, we have made the platform flexible and easy to expand, adding new features seamlessly in future updates.
